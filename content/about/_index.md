My passion for mathematics and statistics started while I was attending university. The more higher-level math classes I took the more I realized how eager I was to learn as much as a I possibly could. My original major was strictly computer science, but I soon found myself taking more advanced math and statistics classes than would ever be required for a computer science degree. I very simply wanted to take those classes and I never minded the heavy workload. Learning more about data science during this time showed me that I could combine the satisfaction of solving real world problems with programming with all the knowledge I gained from my statistics classes. I am driven and hopeful to break into the field of data science by showing off my current abilities and honing those abilities for a lifetime career in data science.
